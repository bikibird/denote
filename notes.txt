PICO-8 speed = # of ticks per note.  1 tick = 1/120 seconds or 120 ticks per second

MIDI ppq # of ticks per quarer note.  

One beat is a quarter note, and a pulse is a tick, so with 100 BPM and 960 PPQ, you have 100 Ã— 960 = 96000 ticks per minute. This is 96000 / 60 = 1600 ticks per second.
So the time, in seconds, is 34560 / 1600 = 21.6 s; the duration is 1920 / 1600 = 1.2 s.

if tempo is 78 bpm  ppq=256 ticks per quarter note and smallest note is 32 ticks, what speed in PICO-8?

(60*120/tempo)*smallest note/ppq= pico speed

(7200/78)*(32/256)=11.53 round up to 12

numerator=7200*smallest ticks/ppq

numerator/tempo

speed=Math.floor((7200/ppq)*ticks/bpm)
Calculate pulses per p8 note ppp8

There are 64 SFX ("sound effects") in a cartridge, used for both sound and music.
	
	Each SFX has 32 notes, and each note has:
		A frequency   (C0..C5)
		An instrument (0..7)
		A volume      (0..7)
		An effect     (0..7)
	
	Each SFX also has these properties:
	
		A play speed (SPD) : the number of 'ticks' to play each note for.
			// This means that 1 is fastest, 3 is 3x as slow, etc.

		Loop start and end : this is the note index to loop back and to
			// Looping is turned off when the start index >= end index

		When only the first of the 2 numbers is used (and the second one is 0),
		it is taken to mean the number of notes to be played. This is normally
		not needed for sound effects (you can just leave the remaining notes
		empty), but is useful for controlling music playback.

Each note is encoded in 16 bits, in Little Endian style, with the low 8 bits in the first byte, and the high 8 bits in the second, formatted like so:

Second byte / High 8 bits	c	e	e	e	v	v	v	w   First byte / Low 8 bits	w	w	p	p	p	p	p	p 
c: when c is 1, waveform is a custom instrument corresponding to sfx 0-7; otherwise it is one of the eight built-in waveforms (PICO-8 0.1.11+)
eee: effect (0-7)
vvv: volume (0-7)
www: waveform (0-7)
pppppp: pitch (0-63)
