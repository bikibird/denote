# Denote
## A MIDI demake tool for PICO-8

Denote is a web-based tool for extracting and converting MIDI file data to be played in PICO-8. It's nicely interactive and includes a PICO-8 console built into the page so that you can audition the results before you copy the SFX data. [Try Denote here.](https://bikibird.itch.io/denote)
